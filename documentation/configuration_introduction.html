  <h1>Introduction to Configuration</h1>
  <p>
    In Solace style, configuration is handled by phpBB 3.1 administration extension called <samp>Devlom Configurator.</samp> Installation process of Devlom Configrator was covered in <a href="configurator_install.html" target="bodyinner">first chapter</a>.
  </p>

  <p>To configure <strong>Solace</strong> style, go to phpBB <strong>Administration Control Panel</strong> and click <strong>Extensions</strong> tab. Go to <strong>Devlom Configurator</strong> section and click "Settings". You should be greeted by Devlom Configurator <strong>Colours</strong> section.</p>

  <p>
    In next chapters we're going to describe each Devlom Configurator section. Due to the fact that every section's option is described in the extension itself, we're going to focus on most important parts only.
