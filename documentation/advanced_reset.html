  <h1>Reset Settings to Defaults</h1>

  <p>
    Let's say that you're not satisfied with changes you made in Devlom Configurator. If you want to revert back forum to initial settings (all Devlom Configurator sections will be reverted to default settings including footer content, copyright etc..) you just have to delete one file:
  </p>
  <pre>solace/config.yaml</pre>
  <p>
    That's it. You may also <strong>Purge the cache</strong> and you're done.
