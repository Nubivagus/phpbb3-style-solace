  <h1>Installing Devlom Configurator Extension</h1>

		<p>First, you will need to unpackage Devlom Configurator extension on your computer. Devlom Configurator is zipped into one ThemeForest package which contains following files and directories: </p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Documentation/
    devlom.zip
    solace.zip</code><span class="copy-to-clipboard" title="Copy to clipboard"></span></pre>

    <p>Devlom Configurator extension is inside <strong>devlom.zip</strong>.</p>

		<p>In Windows, to unzip the extension, simply double click <strong>devlom.zip</strong> from the Windows Explorer view (for instance, if you downloaded the extension to My Documents, you would open My Documents and double click the file). Proceed to click "Extract all files" under the address bar (Windows Vista, 7 and 8) or under the Folder Tasks menu (Windows XP) from within the Explorer window and follow the prompts.</p>
		<p>On Mac, zipped files are automatically unzipped upon download by Safari (this setting can be disabled by unticking "Open safe files" in Safari's preferences) and can be accessed through the downloads list.</p>
		<p>Make sure that your devlom extension includes all the required files as described below:</p>

    <h3>2. Upload to your board</h3>
		<p>To upload extension files, open your favourite FTP client (such as FileZilla, CuteFTP, SmartFTP, etc - even some internet web browsers have this capability) and log in to your account. Generally your publicly accessible files will be in an area named "<samp>public_html</samp>" or similar. Navigate to your board folder. You would need to navigate to the "<samp>ext/</samp>" directory once you are in your board folder.</p>
		<p>Drag the folder "<samp>devlom/configurator</samp>" to the "<samp>ext</samp>" folder in your FTP client. Normally there will be a small folder icon within the FTP client (this may vary from client to client) followed by the name of the directory - this is where you should be dragging the file to. If there is already an "<samp>devlom</samp>" folder inside your "<samp>ext</samp>" folder, then just copy the "<samp>configurator</samp>" folder to "<samp>ext/devlom/</samp>".</p> After whole operation. Folder structure inside "<samp>ext</samp>" directory should look like this:

      <p><img alt="Folder Structure" src="screenshots/folder_structure.png"></p>

		<h3>3. Enable</h3>
		<p>Once the Devlom Configurator extension has been uploaded, navigate in the board's <strong>Administration Control Panel</strong> to Customise -&gt; Manage extensions. You should see your recently uploaded extension listed under "Disabled Extensions". Simply click its "Enable" button and installation is complete!</p>
